# Epileptic Seizure Detection using EEG Signal Processing

The project gives us an approach to find epileptic seizure disease to human brain. Different combinations of the features are being applied from the dataset to our LDA classifier model. The accuracy, precision, recall and f1-score are then compared in order to get the best set of features for detection.
